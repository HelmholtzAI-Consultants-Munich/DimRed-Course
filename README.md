# A practical guide to dimensionality reduction

This course aims to show how to perform dimensionality reduction in practice. Please go to the notebooks folder and open notebook 1_feature_transformation.ipynb. Your mentor will give you further instructions.

It is recommended to use Google colab to run the notebooks (Google account required). For that, just follow the link within the notebook.

Alternatively, you can set up an environment on your own machine as follows, but please note that due to time restrictions, mentors cannot provide help with installation issues during the course.

Setup steps (not needed for colab users):

- Clone or download the repo
- Run the following commands in a terminal
```
conda create -n dimred python=3.10
conda activate dimred
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Open 1_feature_transformation.ipynb from the notebooks folder and select dimred as kernel
